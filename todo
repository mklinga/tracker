timetracker

Idea:

The project works on top of node.js, saving its data in mongodb. Client uses ajax-calls to server, which provides a rest api. Client is a single-page-application with some different views (add new items, edit tracked times, etc.).

** Libraries/tools **

- node.js
	- mongoose
	- express

- client
	- backbone?
	- ajax calls?


** Roadmap **

0.0.1. Build server that serves html (through apache/nginx?)

0.0.2. Learn to use mongodb for saving/querying data from server

0.0.3. Read data from client

0.0.4. Build views on client

0.0.5. Start building project functionality
