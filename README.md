timetracker
========

This will be a small application to track used time on different tasks. 

The project will work on top of node.js, saving its data in mongodb. Client then uses ajax-calls to this server, which provides a rest api. Client is a single-page-application with some different views (main "dashboard", adding new items, editing tracked times and so on).
